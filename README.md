# macOS Web

This open source project aims to replicate some of the macOS(Big Sur, at the time of writing)'s desktop experience on web, using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!

ðŸ”—ðŸ”— [macOS Web](https://macosweb.netlify.app/)

# Why

I've always been very fascinated with macOS, and have never owned a Macbook. So I'm making the most beautiful aspect of macOS, its desktop, myself. For web. Inspired from [WinXP](https://winxp.now.sh/).

# Stack

- Framework - JavaScript
- Component Library - None!!
- Styling Solution - CSS.
